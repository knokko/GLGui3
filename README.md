# GLGui3
The sub library for my Gui library that is required for using Gui with lwjgl 3

The easiest way to use this library is by downloading 'GLGui3 standalone.jar' and adding it to your build path. 
That jar contains Gui,GLGui3,lwjgl,lwjgl-glfw and lwjgl-opengl. If you do that, you will have the entire build path ready.

Then take a look at github.com/knokko/Gui for instructions of how to use the Gui library and use GLGuiWindow instead of AWTGuiWindow.
